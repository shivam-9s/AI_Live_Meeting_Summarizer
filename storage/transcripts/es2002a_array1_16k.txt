 don't assume hundred trees produce to open  hi  third open he left the have you done yeah yeah right did it's totally yes notice nice worst fucking kidding i'm there this is this what we're going to be doing is trying to finance so personal make sure that we all know each other time were treated to reach to introduce yourself hi i'm david and i'm supposed to be industrialism a thing i'm andrew and i'm a marketing experts on craig biggio to this great i the answer exciting new control and oh up recorded his arrogance lip service do that under included when he arrived don't yes it is a design you can too as is that spirit you know trendy and user friendly so that's kind of our brain the i am answer three different stages to the design or you what would you guys have already received them nothing else what to do that come with i just got the project announcement the project designing control the evidence in regards surrogate have like individual work in a meeting but it repeat the process three times and at this point to get child though i pored over there adam sarah he gets to a favor moment some up your favorite characteristics of it so he liked in iraq the hi one hero right my farewell he's  a video her gets very characteristic some yeah right bob three i've heard a frame know for me as a be willing to take a lot of physical affection from the family a lot of personality around the he first robust good health review sounds me  he wanted huh then the smoking very early on but they've come real i'm available  here take as long as the difference he of because number atlanta day every day fifty let your interaction he told the whole lot more the beagles kids to have to get you have begun i don't know anything he can spot impressionists joe is that a whale yeah the following i don't insist first i like big of the top of my head yes the reason is because i'm allergic to most animals budget animal for so of fish was a natural choice yeah and i cannot i wales he everything in sight the nearby partners and marmalade interesting  super sketch brother it feels with thing to the dog as well that's to had to contend with my like   i see a dog in there there now it's yours too  what kind of and he's a mixture a nice thing as whatever that is very friendly anterior or pleased to see when affectionate and it's quite rightly as take out team as states  hey if anything related to is he aware that this is alternative until to isn't it it is he really doesn't actually said is that the list all this and scam and searches and his tail the and after dinner dalton calling when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it is forbidden condition hundred and twenty five is just a new   okay when i need to discuss to put it finance supreme we're going to be selling miserable can for twenty five euro and were aiming to make fifteen million and so going to be son my son international scale the widow and it cost a more than twelve fifty or so fifty percent to the selling price trying to discover that again sure our service i'm so cost like production cost is also got trophy or to boot selling prices is a wholesaler return like on the shelf and you know i imagine that's a good our sale or as the my my new probably is honestly honestly because it's probably a via the retailer to ourselves would of passed they want and but i don't have been doing the fact that it's going to be sold international one have a bearing on honey design it at all yes ill right away i'm wondering if there is sam like the dvd players if there are zones agents mr frequencies are some as well as said characters different keep our styles and some the from child and gonna be was present depends on how complicated the does make sense from maybe to design point of view because he has more complicated characters like european languages than any movements yeah possibly can and then and then all of the other thing international with on top of the price tag game the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region where as in another to be different who decides to declared just i care about us to the country like has money people have to spend on tours just like basic product but positioning the twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london might not be such a big hit greece men get my disappeared time  huh where away were making some kind of assumptions about what what information were given here thinking catering the probably mean something other than just basic yeah something other than just standard so i'm wondering right away selling twenty five years is that sort of that that is going to be like the premium product how much does he know control the twenty five minutes voted eighteen team or something is it as much as and sixteen seventeen eighteen hundreds of as an outlet for in a country was no hi i get you controller will get you and bs is it has to lick kind of cool gimmicky and hey well it does anybody have anything to add to to the finals the shoot at all have any other background information on like how that compares to other now i see them other to live nation you like where your money will get you know   here interesting thing about discussing own production a remote control for me is that the as you point out i still think remote controls being someone something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes the sky jeremy like he has represented by how do you i am you want one we look at to be well the people producing television sets maybe they have to buy now controls on our way of maybe people who have tv sets for really fed up with their remote control and they really want better one of something return to him by close because i live without providing for if i didn't look crosswords right right the guess insists i made my son's group read same function unimpaired is might be too to buy as many users that said you think i should be like a man designing them have learned that been of of a dear or satellite dinner italian your vcr in everything will i can maybe what we could use as a sort of like an example of a successful for the peace technology is palm palm pilots they're gone from being just like little of scribble boards two cameras and be three players telephones everything agenda so they go under if we might add something new to the to the remote control market such as the lighting in your house or played in a new supplies and what you want a lot slightly my to in their own damn sentences america other thing and i did i need the extra functionality yeah like personally for me at home i've i've combined the and the audio video on my television set and my dvd player from a cd player so they well were actually function together but i differ remote controls me to the says serve ironic that that than there in there you know the sound everything is just one system that the twins got it's own little print and i cannot wrap up pretty quickly and so anything else and give us our by what they don't like about what was the keys what they would really liked the part of this new one you keep using them he plays in the uk finding them we young people need help meaning sushi quite small oil when you wanted right to be on the couch under the table where he get guns month weaknesses were if you like with salami creating high pitched noise they bpm there is absolutely don't include to think oh sure a member when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable actually to killed between as a tv and big like buttons that survey like on and blenders them a pagan and you know nothing about what they are now it's better but actually it's still kind of at an early a massive junkie thing on the table stable we get the about how can be more know streamline save like touchscreen or something something like that in or whatever the technologically reasonable okay with a credit card this would be that it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better but that just the appeal to patch and of not having you know these days are very few things people's homes are becoming more and more like sheikh you know nicer materials and became my be can be worth exploring right well and so it is to refer the next meeting sunday and thirty minutes says fight about ten to twelve by mountains and so and between nine then as the industrial designer they're to be working on him that and get the design of that city in a again nice your interface technical sanctions against that scene and i put into right foot lfc actually day he wants me the just thinking about what it actually what you know what requirements it has to pass to fulfill get instruction the t  he assisted the functional it is next  nothing to the missing since i got a little less until and same before we wrap up just make sure all same page and three given to them example of a coffee machine for tonight well oh are we have made right now on the assumption that are television remote control may have features which go beyond the television why are we getting sort of like a design commitment to television features okay well despite what it is whispers to finish night and i guess i thought test nine he probably on some kind of unique selling point of it object so and ninety one factor with the production cost okay because there's a cat they're so early okay depends on how much you can cram into that price yeah i think that's the main actor that's okay let me think thank you for coming get them  chris hi  i continued to see the on getting try to about this try try pushing the function if he didn't yeah it's just getting the screen   this is all very high tech must say  as do you guys go back to the north eastern accent what's of unplugging good thing we we don't have a catheter that's that's not that bad and were careful  two  to year  horses are eating wanted to let you know sdp via our lives computer design on operating systems and yes of next semester or next monster computer security computer architecture some a dinner service sorry it in for an automotive i don't know you're in turn up any new highly sophisticated well silva said just i have cut i wasn't expecting that five
